# Software Engineering Foundations (Python)

This repo contains my personal implementations and notes from learning core software engineering concepts over the past few months. It focuses on applying theory to code — each file here reflects topics I’ve studied and practiced in depth.

## Structure

- `dsa/`: Data structures, algorithms, recursion, and algorithm problem-solving (including selected LeetCode solutions)
- `oop/`: Object-oriented programming, SOLID principles, and design patterns in Python

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to internalize software engineering fundamentals and write clean, modular, and well-tested code in Python. Everything here was written by me, with emphasis on clarity, reasoning, and maintainability.

## Topics Covered

- Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs)
- Algorithms (recursion, search, sort, ...)
- Object-Oriented Design
- SOLID Principles
- Software Design Patterns
- LeetCode-style problem solving

This repo is still evolving — I regularly revisit and refine parts of it as I learn more.
